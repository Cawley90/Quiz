		<div id="ansField">
		<p>This quiz is designed to challenge your knowledge of the do's and dont's of being a responsible internet user!</p>
		
		<p>Using this quiz is standard.  A question will pop up.  Read the question, and find an answer that you think is correct.  Be careful though, because some of them aren't correct!  Throwing some crazy stuff at you here, I know.  When you've found an answer you feel is right (but probably isn't), click the "Submit" button to see if you're correct.</p>
		
		<p>I hope I didn't lose you there.  Let's get started with the first question, if you don't understand the rules, consider this trial by fire.  Click the "Start" button to take the quiz!  Or click the big red "X" button on your browser and do something else.  I don't care, it won't hurt my feelings.</p>
